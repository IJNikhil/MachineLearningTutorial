Problem Statement: Can we accurately predict the stock levels of products based on sales data and sensor data on an hourly basis in order to more intelligently procure products from our suppliers?

Data Available:
* Sales data
* Sensor data on storage temperature
* Sensor data on estimated stock levels

Data Selection:
We will use the following data for modeling the problem statement:
    * Sales data:
        * Product ID
        * Quantity sold
        * Timestamp
    * Sensor data on storage temperature:
        * Sensor ID
        * Timestamp
        * Temperature
    * Sensor data on estimated stock levels:
        * Sensor ID
        * Timestamp
        * Estimated stock level

Modeling Approach:
We will use a machine learning model to predict stock levels based on sales data and sensor data. We will consider the following features:
    * Product ID
    * Quantity sold
    * Timestamp
    * Storage temperature
    * Estimated stock level

Model Evaluation:
We will evaluate the model on a held-out test set to assess its accuracy. We will use the following metrics to evaluate the model:
    * Mean absolute error (MAE)
    * Mean squared error (MSE)
    * R-squared

Productionization:
Once we have developed a satisfactory model, we will deploy it to production so that it can be used to predict stock levels on an hourly basis.

Timeline:
We estimate that the project will take 6 weeks to complete. The following is a high-level timeline:
    * Week 1: Data preparation and exploratory data analysis
    * Week 2: Feature engineering and model selection
    * Week 3: Model training and evaluation
    * Week 4: Model deployment
    * Week 5: Performance monitoring and feedback
    * Week 6: Final report and presentation

Conclusion:
We are confident that we can develop a machine learning model to accurately predict stock levels based on sales data and sensor data. This model will enable the client to more intelligently procure products from their suppliers and reduce waste.

Business Value:
Predicting stock levels with accuracy can help the client to:
    * Reduce inventory costs
    * Improve customer satisfaction
    * Increase sales

Questions for the Data Science Team Leader and the Client:
    * What are the specific business goals for this project?
    * What are the key performance indicators (KPIs) that we will use to measure the success of the project?
    * What are the data quality challenges that we may face?
    * How can we ensure that the model is deployed and used effectively in production?

Next Steps:
Once we have received feedback from the Data Science team leader and the client, we will proceed with the next steps of the project, including data preparation, exploratory data analysis, feature engineering, model selection, model training, and model evaluation.
